# listing-script
A simple script to create listing files for one of my university courses.

# Call parameters
python program arg1 arg2 [arg3, arg4 ....] <br>
where: <br>
arg1 - name of the file to make a listing for, or 
       a regular expression for a bunch of such files <br>
       arg2 - name of a file for listing output <br>
       arg3, arg4, ... - the names of files in the order you want 
              to see them in the output. For files not listed here
              here the order is undefined. <br>
   If you want to compile your files using javac to get error messages, change the compile variable to True.
